<Note>
  Use api's to interface with CallX platform.
</Note>

## Welcome

This section will provide you with all the information you will need to start utilising our open api endpoints. API's allow you to get information or utilise some part of the CallX platform through an interface. An example of how you might use this is to get all of the call summary information from your calls and then display the data on your own custom dashboard.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
